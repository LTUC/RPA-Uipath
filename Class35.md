# Class35 : OCR Automation Robot  

## Outcomes

- Build OCR Automation Robot.

## Robot Idea

What happens when the PDF file is a scanned image, such as a printed receipt? How will UiPath read the text? The answer is Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which converts text in image format to actual text. This robot loops through scanned receipt PDFs/Images, scrapes the text and exports it into a text file.
